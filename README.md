# Bristol-independent-small-businesses

The entire world is going through harsh times at the moment. In order to stop the virus spreading any further, the recommendation is to stay home, social distancing and avoid any unnecessary travel and outing. 

Supporting small independent businesses in Bristol is possible even when staying in by ordering takeaways/takeouts/deliveries. 
Please feel free to add any independant shops here. 

## Are delivery services safe? 

For now, the answer is yes. 
According to [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/yes-you-can-order-food-delivery-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-heres-how/) "There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food or food packaging, according to the CDC and the FDA, though germs are known to live on surfaces up to nine days. The bigger potential issue is transmitting the new coronavirus from delivery person to customer, or vice versa, through coughing, vaporized air particles or other direct contact."

This is the [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/coronavirus?iid=HP_M2_2_CORONAVIRUS) official statement regarding the Coronavirus: Public Health England (PHE) has advised that people receiving parcels are not at risk of contracting the coronavirus. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these types of viruses donâ€™t survive long on objects, such as letters or parcels. This complements the highly publicised guidance from PHE for people to wash their hands more often than usual using soap and hot water.
